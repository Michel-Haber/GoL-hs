# GoL

## Introduction
This is a small haskell implementation of the "Game Of Life"
zero-player game. The implementation is meant to be as simple
and straightforward as possible, without overzealous focus on
performance and optimisation.

## Structure
We basically have two library modules for our program:
* The first module contains the game logic.
* The second module contains a graphics implementation for the game in Gloss.

We also have our Main module, in which we set the standard rules for the game
and call the appropriate functions to run the simulation.
